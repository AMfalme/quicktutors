#QuickTutors

This is the final project for our "Formulacion de Proyectos" course in our university, we had to develop a full product with all the corresponding documents for it.

- Administrative Organization Plan
- Financial Analysis
- Market Analysis
- Technical Analysis

Our idea for the final project was to make an app, that allows our users to see all the students in their university that have registered in our app as tutors. Allowing them to select the one that best fits their needs and set up a study session for any project or exam they may have to prepare for.

###Application
We decided to make our application in a technology we didn't knew, or only had the basics so we could do our project but at the same time learn some new coding skills. because it would be really boring to do all that theoric work and not have a little fun learning something new right? :P

- Language: Python
- Framework: Django 1.9.0
- Design Pattern: Material Design

###Our Application Functionality:
- User Profiles
- Tutoring sessions
